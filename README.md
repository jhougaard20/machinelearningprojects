# Machine Learning Projects
A group of projects I have worked on using Machine Learning to continue to learn and develop skills while also demonstrating my passion for machine learning and desire to continue learning as much as I can.

This will also serve as a portfolio for machine learning projects I have worked on. For now, this consists entirely of projects done on my own, none of these are for an employer.
